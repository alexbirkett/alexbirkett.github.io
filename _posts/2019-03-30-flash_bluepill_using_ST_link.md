# Programming the Blue Pill using ST-LINK V2

The [STM32F103 "Blue Pill" board](https://www.banggood.com/STM32F103C8T6-Small-System-Board-Microcontroller-STM32-ARM-Core-Board-For-Arduino-p-1058299.html?p=YC161419238657201802) is an inexpensive STM32F103 based microcontroller.

I've previously flashed a USB bootloader to the Blue Pill [using a Raspberry Pi](2018-12-11 flash_blue_pill_using_raspberry_pi.md). The Blue pill's USB connector is

The [ST-LINK V2](https://www.banggood.com/3pcs-3_35V-XTW-ST-LINK-V2-STM8STM32-Simulator-Programmer-Downloader-Debugger-With-20cm-Dupont-Wire-p-1183115.html?p=YC161419238657201802) programmer provides a more reliable way to flash the Blue Pill boards in addition to debugging capabilities.

# Connecting the Blue Pill to the STM-32

| ST-LINK V2 | Blue Pill |
| :---------------------: | :------:|
| PIN 2 SWCLK | SWCLK|
| PIN 4 SWDIO | SWDIO |
| PIN 6 GND   | GND |
| PIN 8 3.3V  | 3.3V |

# Jumper positions
When programming with ST link, it's not necessary to move the jumpers on the Blue Pill board.

# Install Stlink on macOS
`brew install stlink`

`st-info --probe`

```

# Unlock flash (if necessary)

When I ran `st-info --probe`, one of my Blue Pill boards reported reported `flash: 0` This was fixed by [unlocking the flash using OpenOCD](https://github.com/texane/stlink/issues/192).

## Install OpenOCD and telnet
`brew install openocd`

`brew install telenet`

## Run OpenOCD:

In one terminal:

`sudo /usr/local/bin/openocd -f /usr/local/share/openocd/scripts/interface/stlink-v2.cfg -f /usr/local/share/openocd/scripts/target/stm32f1x.cfg`

Leave OpenOCD running and proceed to the next step.

##  Connect with telenet

In a second terminal:

`telnet localhost 4444`

```
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
Open On-Chip Debugger
```
`flash probe 0`

```
