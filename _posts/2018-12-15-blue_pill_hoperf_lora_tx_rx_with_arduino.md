# Blue Pill Lora Transmitter Receiver with HopeRF module and Arduino IDE


I became interested in LoRa after watching [Andreas Spiess's LoRa / LoRaWAN Range World Record Attempt video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adhWIo-7gr4).

I wondered if I could connect a LoRa module directly to a flight controller and use it to receive telemetry from a quadcopter or an RC plane.

Having no experience with LoRa, SPI or microcontrollers, I decided the best path forward would be to build something simple to test a LoRa modules. Using the Arduino IDE appeared to be the easiest way to get something working quickly. Arduino has a thriving community and lots of tutorials.

I used a [STM32F103 "Blue Pill" board](https://www.banggood.com/STM32F103C8T6-Small-System-Board-Microcontroller-STM32-ARM-Core-Board-For-Arduino-p-1058299.html?rmmds=myorder&cur_warehouse=CN) and a [RFM95W](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/RFM95W-RFM95-868MHz-LORA-SX1276-wireless-transceiver-module-20DBM-3KM-Best-quality/32810607598.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.e6654c4dAICK7j) module. The Blue Pill is not a typical Arduino board, it uses an STM32 microcontroller with some architectural similarities to the microcontrollers found in many flight controllers used in racing quads and RC planes.

# Blue Pill tools setup

The Blue Pill does not have a USB bootloader installed out of the box. If you want to use a USB bootloader it has to be loaded using either ST-LINK or a TTL UART.


I did not have a [ST-LINK V2 STM8 / STM32 Simulator Programmer clone](https://www.banggood.com/5pcs-3_35V-XTW-ST-LINK-V2-STM8STM32-Simulator-Programmer-Downloader-Debugger-With-20cm-Dupont-Wire-p-1195827.html?p=YC161419238657201802) or a working TTL UART serial converter e.g. [GeekcreitÂ® FT232RL FTDI USB To TTL Serial Converter Adapter Module For Arduin](https://www.banggood.com/Wholesale-Warehouse-FT232RL-FTDI-USB-To-TTL-Serial-Converter-Adapter-Module-For-Arduino-wp-Eu-917226.html?p=YC161419238657201802), so [I used a Raspberry Pi to flash a USB bootloader to the Blue Pill](flash_blue_pill_using_raspberry_pi.md).

The best "Hello world" introduction to the Blue Pill I found was [
Joop Brokking's Getting started with the STM32 microcontroller - STM32F103C8T6 via Arduino](
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLEQk73zJoU).

After downloading and installing the Arduino IDE, I installed  "Arduino SAM Boards (32-bit ARM Cortex-M3) by Arduino" version 1.6.11 from Tools -> Boards -> Boards Manager in the Arduino IDE.

I cloned the [Roger Clark's Arduino STM32](https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32) into the `hardware` directory of Arduino IDE:

E.g. on macOS, In a terminal:

```
cd /Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Java/hardware
git clone git@github.com:rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32.git
```

I was on commit `9a489ca25fa2794bd39d4d2d46e1d9d3ecd733e2`

# Hardware
## Antenna
I used the 868 MHz version of the RFM95W module for use in the EU. I soldered an 86.5 mm trailing wire which I [believe is appropriate for 868 MHz](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/forum/t/antenna-length-for-868-and-433-mhz/5378).

![Antenna connected to HopeRF RFM95W](/assets/images/blue_pill_hoperf_lora_tx_rx_with_arduino/antenna.jpg)

## Wiring the HopeRF Module to the Blue Pill.

I soldered [female jumper cables](https://www.banggood.com/40pcs-10cm-Female-To-Female-Jumper-Cable-Dupont-Wire-For-Arduino-p-994059.html?p=YC161419238657201802) to the HopeRF RFM95W.

I connected to the HopeRF RFM95W to the Blue Pill as follows:

| HopeRF module | Blue Pill |
| :---------------------: | :------:|
| VCC | 3.3V |
| GND | GND |
| SCK | PA5 |
| MISO | PA6 |
| MOSI | PA7 |
| NSS | PA4 |
| NRESET | PC14 |
| DIO0 | PA1 |
| DIO1 | PB13 |
| DIO2 | PB12 |

# Software

I used [armtronix's Modified lib of sandeepmistry arduino-LoRa for STM32F103](https://github.com/armtronix/arduino-LoRa-STM32). The documentation mentions only Semtech SX1276/77/78/79 not the HopeRF module.

I'm not sure how non-arduino blessed libraries are best imported into the Arduino IDE. I ended up doing "Sketch -> Add file" for `LoRa_STM32.cpp` and `LoRa_STM32.h`

In `LoRa_STM32.cpp` I changed `#include <LoRa_STM32.h>` to `#include "LoRa_STM32.h"` because `LoRa_STM32.h` was now part of the project not a library.

In `LoRa_STM32.h`, I changed `#define LORA_DEFAULT_RESET_PIN PC13` to `#define LORA_DEFAULT_RESET_PIN PC14` because on the Blue Pill, PC13 is connected to a LED that I'm using to indicate when a packet is sent or received.

## The LoRa Transmitter

I made a transmitter application based on the example code. Instead of printing to the serial device, it flashes the LED when a packet is sent.

{% highlight C %}
int counter = 0;

void setup() {
  pinMode(PC13, OUTPUT);
  LoRa.setSpreadingFactor(12);
  if (!LoRa.begin(868E6)) {
    while (1);
  }
}

void loop() {
  // send packet

  LoRa.beginPacket();
  LoRa.print("hello ");
  LoRa.print(counter);
  LoRa.endPacket();
  counter++;
  digitalWrite(PC13, LOW);
  delay(100);
  digitalWrite(PC13, HIGH);

  delay(5000);
}
{% endhighlight %}


## The LoRa Receiver

I made a receiver application based on the example code. Instead of printing to the serial device, it flashes the LED twice when a packet is received. The double blink was useful since the transmitter and the receiver look identical.

{% highlight C %}
#include <SPI.h>
#include "LoRa_STM32.h"

void setup() {
  pinMode(PC13, OUTPUT);

  LoRa.setSpreadingFactor(12);
  if (!LoRa.begin(868E6)) {
    while (1);
  }
}

void loop() {
  int packetSize = LoRa.parsePacket();
  if (packetSize) {
    while (LoRa.available()) {
      LoRa.read();
    }
    digitalWrite(PC13, LOW);
    delay(100);
    digitalWrite(PC13, HIGH);
    delay(100);
    digitalWrite(PC13, LOW);
    delay(100);
    digitalWrite(PC13, HIGH);
}
{% endhighlight %}
