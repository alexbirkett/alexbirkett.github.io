# Flashing Blue Pill using Raspberry Pi

I've recently received some [STM32F103 "Blue Pill" boards](https://www.banggood.com/STM32F103C8T6-Small-System-Board-Microcontroller-STM32-ARM-Core-Board-For-Arduino-p-1058299.html?p=YC161419238657201802) from Banggood. I thought the Blue Pill was interesting because it's cheap and it has some architectural similarities with the F4 flight controllers I've used to build a quads.

A challenge with the Blue Pill is that you can't upload Arduino code to it via USB out of the box. A USB bootloader needs to be installed first.

Flashing the USB bootloader (or uploading any other code) can be done with TTL serial converter. I ordered the [GeekcreitÂ® FT232RL FTDI USB To TTL Serial Converter Adapter Module For Arduino](https://www.banggood.com/Wholesale-Warehouse-FT232RL-FTDI-USB-To-TTL-Serial-Converter-Adapter-Module-For-Arduino-wp-Eu-917226.html?p=YC161419238657201802) but the USB pins fell out of it when I attempted to insert a cable.

I borrowed an old Arduino USB2Serial connector but I could not get that to work either. According to Roger Clarke, [the internal serial bootloader in the F103 does not work well with all USB to Serial adaptors](https://www.stm32duino.com/viewtopic.php?t=2569#p34232)

But I did have a Rasberry Pi and I knew that it had a TTL UART but had no idea how to use it to flash a Blue Pill. I did some research and quickly discovered that that Mathew Dunn had the same idea. He made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCcxFMU1OFE) and a [blog post](https://siliconjunction.wordpress.com/2017/03/21/flashing-the-stm32f-board-using-a-raspberry-pi-3/) about it.

Unlike Mathew, I have the original Raspberry Pi model B, not a Raspberry Pi 3. My steps are adapted from his. The link to the boot bootloader in his post no longer works and I needed to reboot the Pi after disabling the serial console. These were the steps I followed:

# Install the stm32flash utility
```
git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/stm32flash/code stm32flash-code
make
sudo make install
```

# Move the high performance UART from the Bluetooth device to the GPIO pins
This was not necessary on the original Raspberry Pi Model B but this step is detailed in Mathew Dunn's [blog post](https://siliconjunction.wordpress.com/2017/03/21/flashing-the-stm32f-board-using-a-raspberry-pi-3/)

# Remove console from serial port

Edit cmdline.txt:

```
sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt
```

Remove the following text in cmdline.txt to prevent a console from running on the serial port:

```
console=serial0,115200
```

# Reboot the Raspberry Pi


# Connect Raspberry to Blue Pill

|   Raspberry Pi | Blue Pill  |
|---|---|
|  3.3V (PIN 1) | 3.3V |
|  GND (pin 6) |  GND
|   TX (pin 8) |  RX (pin A10) |
|   RX (pin 10) | TX (pin A9) |

# Flashing a boot-loader
```git clone https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/STM32duino-bootloader```

If you want to use the Arduino IDE  you can use the image below, alternatively you could flash your own compiled binary directly to the micro-controller.


Press the RESET button on your micro controller before running stm32flash

```
stm32flash -v -w ./STM32duino-bootloader/bootloader_only_binaries/generic_boot20_pb12.bin /dev/serial0
```

Restore the jumpers to their original configuration.
