The [Happymodel Mobula7](
https://www.banggood.com/Happymodel-Mobula7-75mm-Crazybee-F3-Pro-OSD-2S-Whoop-FPV-Racing-Drone-w-700TVL-Camera-BNF-p-1357971.html?p=YC161419238657201802) is a 2S whoop class drone. I pre-ordered immediately after watching [UAVfutures' review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bhk-z1n3jU). Stew described the Mobula7 as, "The most impressive whoop I've ever seen." I think it would be hard to fake the enthusiasm in the video.

I bought the EU-LBT version of the Mobula7:
![EU-LBT Mobula7](/assets/images/mobula7_EU/Mobula7_EU.jpg)


LBT stands for listen before talk and is, according to [Painless 360](https://youtu.be/C5xpq5ti5Gk?t=300), mandated in the EU by [ETSI EN 300 328 V1.8.1]( https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/300300_300399/300328/01.08.01_30/en_300328v010801v.pdf). Listen before talk is mechanism by which a transmitter first checks if a channel is in use before transmitting.

The EU-LBT receiver version of the Mobula7 currently costs 12% more than the other receiver versions, weighs more and has two extra antennas that increase drag. The extra cost and weight is due to an external [Frsky XM+ receiver]( https://www.banggood.com/Frsky-XM-Micro-D16-SBUS-Full-Range-Receiver-Up-to-16CH-p-1110020.html?p=YC161419238657201802). According to the manufacturer, the XM+ receiver weighs 1.6 grams.

The EU-LBT and non-EU versions of the FrSky protocol use the same frequency band and hardware. The only difference is the firmware that runs on the transmitter and receiver.

The Mobula7 uses a [Racerstar Crazybee F3 Pro Flight Controller](
 https://www.banggood.com/Racerstar-Crazybee-F3-Pro-Flight-Controller-Mobula7-5A-1-2S-Compatible-Flysky-or-Frsky-or-DSMX-Receiver-p-1361634.html?p=YC161419238657201802) which is available in three versions:

* Compatible DSM2/DSMX Receiver
* Compatible Flysky Receiver
* Compatible Frsky Receiver (non-EU)

Non-EU Frsky support is provided by a [TI CC2500 2.4 GHz RF Transceiver](http://www.ti.com/product/CC2500) soldered directly on to the Crazybee F3 Pro.

The [TI CC2500](http://www.ti.com/product/CC2500) transceiver chip is used both by FrSky and [other](https://github.com/pascallanger/DIY-Multiprotocol-TX-Module/blob/master/Protocols_Details.md) transmitter manufacturers e.g. Futaba.

According to the Betaflight [FrSky SPI documentation RX](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/blob/master/docs/FrSky%20SPI%20RX.md), FrSky protocol support has been added by a third party, [midelic](https://github.com/midelic), who reverse engineered the FrSky protocol. This code is is part of [Betaflight](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight) (but currently not [INAV](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav))

The [Multiprotocol TX Module](https://github.com/pascallanger/DIY-Multiprotocol-TX-Module/) is another project that has reverse engineered the FrSky protocol. It also uses the [TI CC2500](http://www.ti.com/product/CC2500) chip. The Multiprotocol TX Module supports both EU and non-EU versions of the [FRSKYX aka D16 protocol ](https://github.com/pascallanger/DIY-Multiprotocol-TX-Module/blob/master/Protocols_Details.md#FRSKYX---15) which leads me to believe there is no reason why the Betaflight receiver could not also support the EU-LBT version FrSky protocol. The [Frsky XM+ receiver]( https://www.banggood.com/Frsky-XM-Micro-D16-SBUS-Full-Range-Receiver-Up-to-16CH-p-1110020.html?p=YC161419238657201802) was only added to the EU version of the Mobula7 because of missing software support in Betaflight.

I did not know any of this when the Mobula7 arrived. Transmitter binding instructions came in the box but they had fallen on the floor. The [binding instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7lHumHW0UE) I found on Youtube did not work for the EU-LBT version because you have to bind the external Frsky XM+ receiver not the receiver soldered onto the flight controller.

Maybe in the future, support for the EU-LBT FrSky protocol will be added to Betaflight. I raised a [feature request](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/issues/7341).
